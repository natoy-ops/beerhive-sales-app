### Fixed

- **Critical: Cancelled orders now remain visible**
  - Previously: Orders disappeared when items were removed from tabs
  - Now: Orders marked as CANCELLED and remain visible until manually removed
  - Root cause: Foreign key constraint with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
  - Solution: Database migration to use `ON DELETE SET NULL`

- **Kitchen/Bartender workflow clarity**
  - READY orders now auto-hide to reduce clutter
  - Clear visual indicators for cancelled items
  - Staff can easily identify and manage cancelled orders

#### Reports & Analytics
- All Products Sold view reworked with two modes and polished UX:
  - Standalone mode: products + packages as distinct items; includes revenue column.
  - Combined mode: merges package component consumption into product quantities; revenue hidden.
- Toggle animations: directional slide (Combined → from left, Standalone → from right).
- Header remains static; only table body animates during toggles.
- Inline package items: smooth expand/collapse (grid row + fade/slide); subtle button border.
- Rank column fixed width for consistent alignment across modes.
- Sticky table header during scroll.
- Export All (Excel):
  - Removed Top Products sheet.
  - All Products Sold sheet reflects active toggle with appropriate headers and sheet name.
  - Combined mode excludes revenue column; Standalone includes it.
- Query robustness: `getSalesByPaymentMethod` lint/type fixes and safer parsing.

- **Tab payment dialog navigation**
  - Fixed white screen issue when closing payment dialog
  - Now properly redirects to /tabs when dialog is closed
  - Works for both X button and Close button
  - Updated `handleClose` to properly handle navigation

### Database

#### Migration: `fix_kitchen_orders_cascade_delete.sql`
```sql
-- Drop CASCADE DELETE constraint
ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS kitchen_orders_order_item_id_fkey;

-- Add SET NULL constraint
ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders
ADD CONSTRAINT kitchen_orders_order_item_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (order_item_id) 
REFERENCES order_items(id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Allow NULL values
ALTER TABLE kitchen_orders
ALTER COLUMN order_item_id DROP NOT NULL;
```

**Impact:**
- Cancelled kitchen orders persist even after order_item deletion
- `order_item_id` can now be NULL
- No data loss for cancelled orders

### Removed

- "Ready" status count from Kitchen and Bartender displays
- "Ready" filter tab from both displays
- "Mark as Served" button (READY orders auto-hide)
- Automatic deletion of PENDING cancelled orders

### Developer Notes

#### Breaking Changes
**None** - This is a backward-compatible release

#### Behavioral Changes
1. **READY orders:** Now immediately hidden from kitchen/bartender views
2. **CANCELLED orders:** Persist until manually removed (was auto-deleted)
3. **Database schema:** `kitchen_orders.order_item_id` is now nullable

#### Migration Requirements
- **Required:** Must run database migration before deployment
- **Recommended:** Backup database before migration
- **Validation:** Test cancelled order flow after deployment

#### API Response Changes
**None** - All endpoints maintain backward compatibility
